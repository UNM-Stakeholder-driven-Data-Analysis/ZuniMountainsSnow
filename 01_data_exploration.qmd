# Data Exploration and Approach

## Zuni Mountains Puerco Project Area Tree Cover 2000-2015

Note: The following data exploration shows results from the Puerco Project Area, which has had many smaller US Forest Service (USFS) activities occur within it in the past. Only recently (03-02-2023) did Livia and I find a complete data set of USFS Activities. The USFS Activities data set includes thinning treatments, locations, and date-completed attributes. The following investigation of data distributions and data relationships will be re-calculated for thinning treatment areas once they are identified.

## Data Exploration

### Data Types

#### Tree Cover Raster Data

**Data source**: <https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/gfcc30tcv003/>

**Variables Of Interest**: raster data where each cell contains a numerical, integer value between zero and one hundred. This value represents fraction of tree cover, 100 being full tree cover. There also exist corresponding pixels which express Tree Cover Error as a percentage (numerical, floating point values between 0 and 100).

**Units**: Raster cells are 30 meters by 30 meters. The data uses the World Geodetic System (WGS84) Datum and UTM zone 13N Projection. The units of the projection are in meters where positive x is east, positive y is north.

#### Project Area Vector Data

**Data Source**: Stakeholder communication and US Forest Service Southwestern Region GIS Data \> Activities: <https://www.fs.usda.gov/detailfull/r3/landmanagement/gis/cid=stelprdb5201889&width=full>

**Variables of Interest**: Polygon vector data which represent the USFS activities, including thinning treatments. Vector coordinates are continuous numerical values. Attributes associated with each polygon include treatment activity and date completed. Vector coordinates use the NAD 1983 datum, and the Lamber Conformal Conic projection.

**Units**: Meters

### Data Distributions

In @fig-perc the percent tree cover is visualized for the Puerco Project area, for the four years for which the tree cover data exists: 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015. Note that the color scale goes from 0 to 53 percent cover. This was the maximum value across all four years.

In @fig-diff the difference between percent tree cover between consecutive years is shown. This is calculated by subtracting the earlier year from the later year. Positive values indicate the tree cover went up for that pixel, negative values indicate the tree cover went down. We expect that regions of reduced tree cover will correlate with thinning treatments.

```{r figs, echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-perc
#| fig-cap: "Percent Tree Cover for the Puerco Project Area, 2000-2015"
p <- levelplot(all, 
               at=seq(0, maxPercent),
               main="Percent Tree cover for the Puerco Project Area",
               xlab='UTM meters',
               ylab='UTM meters',
               margin=FALSE)
plot(p)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-diff
#| fig-cap: "Difference in Percent Tree Cover for consecutive years (later year - earlier year)"
diffs <- c(all$yr2015 - all$yr2010, all$yr2010-all$yr2005, all$yr2005-all$yr2000)
names(diffs) <- c("yr2015vs2010", "yr2010vs2005", "yr2005vs2000")
p <- levelplot(diffs, 
          main="Difference in Percent Tree cover for the Puerco Project Area",
          xlab='UTM meters',
          ylab='UTM meters',
          margin=FALSE,

                            strip.background=list(col="white")))
p <- diverge0(p, 'PiYG')
plot(p)
```

@fig-hist shows a histogram of percent tree cover values for the tree cover data within the Puerco Project area, for all four years. Evidence of an overall trend in reduced tree cover over time is shown by higher density regions moving towards lower percent cover between 2005 and 2015. This may be a result of USFS vegetation treatments which include prescribed burns, tree thinning, and mechanical mastication. This data is not normal. It does exhibit a pattern where higher densities occur at lower percent tree-cover values. A different view is included in @fig-hist, where relative frequencies for each percent class (0-53, integer values) are shown.

```{r echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-hist
#| fig-cap: "Relative Frequency of Percent Cover separated by year"

freq_2000 <- RelFreq(zm_c_2000) %>% mutate(year=2000)
