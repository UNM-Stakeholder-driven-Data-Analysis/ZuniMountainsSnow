## Plain Language Summary

*Are the U.S Forest Service forest thinning projects affecting the snowpack accumulation potential in the Zuñi mountains of New Mexico?*

Snowpack is an important source of water for springs and forests in the Zuñi Mountains. The U.S. Forest Service conducts forest thinning projects in the mountains to improve the resilience of forests to frequent-fire patterns and climate change (). It is currently not understood how those thinning projects affect the accumulation of snow in the forest.

Spatial snowpack data is unavailable at high enough resolutions to be useful, but high resolution tree cover data is available. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the *potential* for the forest to accumulate snow based on tree cover. Snow that lands directly on trees is melted and evaporated more rapidly than snow that lands on the ground. Similarly, snow that falls on ground far away from tree cover is melted or moved by the wind more rapidly than snow closer to tree cover. A previous study found that, on average, ground within 15 meters of tree cover retains the most snow (). Manual inspection of google earth imagery in the Zuñi Mountains suggests that bare ground to the north of tree cover accumulates snow, presumably because it is shaded during midday, when the sun's energy is the most intense. Combining these observations suggests that bare ground within 15m of tree cover, and to the north, is optimal for snowpack accumulation. We call this "optimal ground."

We hypothesize that thinning is reducing snowpack accumulation potential because it has the effect of creating more unshaded bare ground greater than 15 meters from tree cover.

The highest resolution tree-cover data currently available represents tree cover as a percentage within each 30meter square (TODO: citation). In order to asses if an area is optimal it is necessary to analyze data that shows the precise locations of tree cover and bare ground. To do this we simulated tree locations based on the percent-cover data. The resulting calculations showed that after a thinning project in 2014 the amount of optimal ground decreased.

## Introduction

Snowpack is an important source of water for springs and forests in the Zuñi Mountains. The U.S. Forest Service conducts forest thinning projects in the mountains to improve the resilience of forests to frequent-fire patterns and climate change (). It is currently not understood how those thinning projects affect the accumulation of snow in the forest. Spatial snowpack data is unavailable at high enough resolutions to be useful, but high resolution tree cover data is available. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the *potential* for the forest to accumulate snow based on tree-cover. Snow that lands directly on trees is melted and evaporated more rapidly than snow that lands on the ground. Similarly, snow that falls on ground far away from tree cover is melted or moved by the wind more rapidly than snow closer to tree cover.

## Prediction

We hypothesize that thinning is reducing snowpack accumulation potential because it has the effect of creating more bare ground that is exposed to the sun.

## Methods

#### Data Sources

The highest resolution tree-cover data currently available represents tree cover as a percentage at 30x30 meters resolution (TODO: citation). Values are the integers 0-100. Error for each cell is also provided, where the error is root mean squared error in units of percent cover (TODO: citation) (TODO: this is my best interpretation but I am not certain) This data includes tree-cover images for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.

The US Forest Service provides a data set of all activities and their spatial extents for the southwest region, as well as data representing forest boundaries (citation). The activity data include the date completed, the project they were a part of, and the type of activity.

#### Choosing a Thinning Project Area

USFS activities were selected that a) occurred in the Zuñi Mountains, b) were between the years 2000 and 2015, and c) not completed anytime within the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. This was to ensure that the treatment did not partially affect a subset of a polygon for a particular year. Activities that were labeled "Thinning for hazardous fuel reduction" were selected and grouped by completion date to create a set of candidate polygon-groups. All other activities deemed to potentially affect tree cover were subtracted away from the candidates. See the Technical Appendices for a detailed description. This ensures that the only activity occurring in the selected area was "Thinning for hazardous fuel reduction."

This resulted in three polygon groups. The largest, which was completed in September of 2014, was also found to have the most significant reduction in tree cover after thinning (see @fig-cover). This polygon is used for the remainder of the analysis. (TODO: time permitting, analyse more polygons, TODO: include a reference image showing polygons within the zuni mountains polygon)

Relative frequency histograms for each cover value, for the chosen polygon, are shown in @fig-hist. The dramatic shift in the peak from 2010 to 2015 indicates that overall the percent cover was reduced over that time period. Note that the maximum value for percent cover is 47% across all years. The average error for all cells with a particular cover value is by color in the plot. Error is RMSE in units of percent cover. The year 2015 has very low error, while the error is between 15% and 19% for previous years. Note that the unusually high occurrence of 0%, 39%, 45% cover cells in the year 2000, and 12% in 2010, do not show abnormally high average error. This indicates that, with respect to error, there is no explanation for the abnormalities. (TODO: a sensitivity analysis will be run to find the effects of randomly excluding enough pixels to even out the histograms)

#### Increasing Resolution via Stochastic Simulation

In order to assess if a cell is optimal or not it is necessary to A) categorize cells as either bare ground or tree-cover and B) use cells that are smaller than the threshold distance of 15m. To avoid using arbitrarily small cells, Google e\\Earth images of the Zuñi Mountains were used to characterize typical tree crown diameter sizes (see @sec-3x3Reasoning for images). Crown diameters were observed to typically range between 3 and 4 meters. Therefore, on the smaller end it can be assumed that a 3x3 meter cell is either bare ground, or completely covered by a tree. Based on this assumption a stochastic simulation was used to generate a 3x3 meter resolution image derived from the 30x30 meter percent-cover image.

The simulation works as follows: Each 30x30 meter cell is subdivided into 100 3x3 meter cells. Because there are 100 sub-cells per 30x30 meter cell, percent cover values translate directly to the number of covered sub-cells. This number of covered sub-cells is distributed randomly within the 30x30 cell. Therefore, the percent cover for the 30x30 cell is preserved. This operation is repeated for each 30x30 meter cell to convert the entire percent-tree-cover image into a simulated tree-cover distribution. This conversion is repeated 100 times for each year to create a spread of possible tree-cover distribution images. Note that clusters of 3x3m cells may be interpreted as multiple small trees or one large tree. See @fig-randExample for an example of one 30x30 meter cell being converted to 3x3 meter resolution via stochastic simulation. @fig-stochsim shows an entire stochastic simulation for the year 2000.

#### Definition Of Optimal Condition for Snowpack Accumulation

Snowpack data is unavailable at high enough resolutions to be useful. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the potential for the forest to accumulate snow based on forest structure alone. A previous study in the Jemez Mountains found that the optimal condition for snowpack accumulation was, on average, clear ground within 15 meters of tree cover (Broxton et al., 2015). According to the study, snow that lands directly on trees is melted and evaporated more rapidly than snow that lands on the ground. Similarly, snow that falls on ground greater than 15 meters from tree cover is also melted, evaporated, or moved by the wind more rapidly than snow closer to tree cover. This approximation does not take into consideration the observed pattern that snow accumulated less on south-facing sides of trees in the Jemez Mountains (Broxton et al., 2015), suggesting that in that region solar irradiation has relatively large impact on snowpack. Inspection of Google Earth satellite imagery for the year 2014, to the immediate west of the chosen thinning project, reveals a strong pattern of snow accumulating to the north of tree cover (see @sec-visAsses). These observations are used to create criteria which classify bare ground as either optimal for snowpack accumulation or not. Because these criterion are simplified models of where snow will accumulate the best, we define multiple possible criterion and assess the impact of different criterion on the final result. Each criteria operates on the 3m x 3m simulated tree cover data, and asses whether a given bare-ground cell is optimal or not.

The chosen criteria are as follows:

##### Midday Shading Criterion: North Line

A bare ground cell is optimal if there is a cluster of tree cover within 15 meters to the south (measured from the southern most edge of the cell). The clusters of tree cover must be at or above a minimum threshold size. Thresholds considered here are 1 and 2 cells, which may be connected by an edge or by a corner. This models snowpack as being primarily affected by midday sun exposure, and allows for small trees to be considered ineffective for sheltering snow. The visual effect of this is each cluster having a line of snow to the north, hence the name North Line.

##### General Shading and Wind Shelter Criterion: North Semicircle

A bare ground cell is optimal when a half-circle area to the south, centered on the cell in question, contains at least a threshold area of tree cover. The radius of the half-circle is roughly 15meters (pixelation prevents an exact circle). Threshold areas are set to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cells, respectively. This corresponds to 9, 18, 27, 36 and 45 m^2^ required covered area.

As the threshold area increases this criterion approaches a model which combines both a) shading accross a wider span of the day and b) protection from wind distribution. This is simply because as the threshold area increases it becomes more likely that cover exists to the south, east, and west, and anywhere in between. Using a half circle to the south is appropriate because it biases the model towards bare ground which is more likely to be shaded during midday. The visual effect of this is groups of tree having snow in a roughly half circle to the north, hence the name North Semicircle

All criteria were applied to each of the 100 simulated images and across all years. A zoomed in image of each criterion applied to one stochastic simulation for the year 2015 is shown in @fig-zoom. TODO: make that image. possibly include 30x30 lines

## Results

Average optimal area is reported in @tbl-results. The range in optimal area across the 100 simulations is also reported. All areas for each simulation, and each year, are shown in @fig-totOptArea. The average total optimal area in the year 2015 was 2.90 km^2^ (717 acres, 89.5% of the thinning area), which is 0.42 km^2^ (100 acres, 13% of thinning area) greater than the average for the other three years (2.48 km^2^).

The total extent of the thinning polygon is 3.24 km^2^.

## Discussion

The expectation was that thinning would create large gaps between trees, and therefore reduce the snowpack accumulation potential of the forest. The results show the opposite pattern. After thinning in 2014 the total amount of optimal area increased from the pre-thinning average of 2.48 km^2^ to 2.90 km^2^, a difference of 0.42 km^2^ (100 acres, 13% of the thinning area) . This implies that for this particular thinning project, the forest was at such a density that the major limitation to snowpack accumulation was interception of snow by trees and that thinning did not create sufficiently large gaps to reduce the optimality of bare-ground.

It is important to note the relatively small variation in total optimal area between stochastic simulations within the same year (see range columns in @tbl-results). This suggests that clusters of more than one low-cover 30x30 meter cells are rare. This is because the number of trees is exactly the same between each simulation, so the only variation in optimal area can come from bare ground greater than 15 meters from tree cover. This condition will only occur where clusters of low-cover 30x30 cells occur. (see Appendix for details). The low variation between simulations may also indicate that the definition of "optimal area" is too generous. As can be seen in @fig-zoom, the current definition of optimal implies that a lone tree in the middle of a field will cause snow to accumulate in a 15 meter circle around it. It is more likely that snow on the south side of such a tree will quickly melt and evaporate. More work will be done to create a definition of optimal area that only includes bare ground within a certain wedge shape to the north of tree cover. It is expected that repeating the above analysis with this definition will result in A) larger variation between simulations and B) a lower relative increase in optimal area between 2014 and preceding years.

Time permitting, these analysis will also be expanded to other thinning project polygons.

## Conclusions

For the thinning project analyzed the snowpack accumulation potential increased after thinning. This suggests that the potential for that forest area to integrate water into the soil has increased. These results are important because they allow USFS managers to understand how thinning treatments may affect the water status of the ecosystem. This result suggests that there are additional benefits to thinning beyond improving the resilience of forests to frequent-fire patterns.

### Classification of USFS Activities

The following activities are assumed to have no effect on tree cover:

### Arriving at the 3-meter minimum cell size {#sec-3x3Reasoning}

My apologies, I plan to redo this analysis to check the 3x3 meter assumption is valid. Google Earth imagery from the years \_\_ \_\_\_ and \_\_\_ within the Zuni Mountains were visually inspected in n=\_\_\_ locations. At each location an area of \_\_ m^2^ was observed to create an impression of a the range in tree crown diameter. Then small and large tree crowns were respectively measured using google-earth's measurement tool.

The following table shows the resulting crown diameters:

### Randomness Validation

In order to verify that the stochastic simulations are indeed random and are representative of the original percent tree-cover data, all the simulation layers were reclassified so that a covered cell had the value 1/100. Then all 100 layers were summed, giving a visual impression of the randomness and a way to compare all the simulations to the original data. If a particular cell was always covered by a tree, the resulting summed image would result in a pixel value of 1. Because percent-cover values never go above 50 a pixel value of 1 should never be observed in the summed simulation image, which is indeed the case. The results are below in @fig-alphasims. For convenience the original percent cover images are included below (@fig-again). Note that the summed image appears to well approximate the original cover image, as expected.
