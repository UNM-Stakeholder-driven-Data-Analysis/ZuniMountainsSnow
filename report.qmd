## Plain Language Summary

*Are the U.S Forest Service forest thinning projects affecting the snowpack accumulation potential in the Zuñi mountains of New Mexico?*

Snowpack is an important source of water for springs and forests in the Zuñi Mountains. The U.S. Forest Service conducts forest thinning projects to improve the resilience of forests to frequent-fire patterns and climate change [@reynolds2013]. It is currently not understood how thinning projects in the Zuñi Mountains have affected the accumulation of snow in the forest.

Spatial snowpack data is unavailable at high enough resolutions to be useful, but high resolution tree cover data is available. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the *potential* for the forest to accumulate snow based on tree cover. A previous study found that, on average, ground within 15 meters of tree cover retains the most snow [@broxton2015a]. Manual inspection of Google Earth Pro imagery in the Zuñi Mountains suggests that bare ground to the north of tree cover accumulates snow, presumably because it is shaded during midday. Combining these observations suggests that bare ground within 15m of tree cover, and to the north, is optimal for snowpack accumulation. This will be referred to as "optimal area."

We hypothesize that thinning is reducing the total amount of optimal area.

The highest resolution tree-cover data currently available represents tree cover as a percentage within each 30meter square [@townshendjohna]. In order to asses if an area is optimal it is necessary to analyze data that shows the precise locations of tree cover and bare ground. To do this we simulated tree locations based on the percent-cover data. The resulting calculations showed that after a thinning project in 2014 the amount of optimal ground decreased.

## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Snowpack is an important source of water for springs and forests in the Zuñi Mountains. The U.S. Forest Service conducts forest thinning projects to improve the resilience of forests to frequent-fire patterns and climate change [@reynolds2013]. It is currently not understood how those thinning projects affect the accumulation of snow in the forest. Spatial snowpack data is unavailable at high enough resolutions to be useful, but high resolution tree cover data is available. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the *potential* for the forest to accumulate snow based on tree cover.

Previous studies indicate that the spatial distribution of tree cover can be used to estimate where snowpack is likely to accumulate. In the Jemez Mountains, a nearby mountain range to the north-east, snow that lands directly on trees is sublimated more rapidly than snow that lands on the ground[@molotch2009]. Conversely, snow that falls on ground far away from tree cover is melted or moved by the wind more rapidly than snow close to tree cover [@broxton2015a]. Therefore, snowpack accumulation is optimized when bare ground is at an intermediate distance from tree canopies (approximately \<15 meters [@broxton2015a]). This will be referred to as "optimal area". Not only is snowpack accumulation greatest at intermediate distances, models indicate it has greater net snow water input to the soil [@broxton2015a]. Therefore the amount of optimal area in a forest may have significant impacts on the water status of the ecosystem.

This study identified a particular USFS thinning project which had a large reduction in tree cover after completion. For this area, simulated distributions of tree cover were derived from the highest resolution tree cover dataset available (30mx30m). A set of likely criteria for defining optimal area were created based on 1) past studies ([@broxton2015a], [@molotch2009]) and 2) visual assessments of satellite imagery. These criteria were applied to the simulated tree distributions to create estimates of total optimal area before and after the thinning project.

## Prediction

We hypothesize that thinning is reducing snowpack accumulation potential because it has the effect of creating more unshaded bare ground greater than 15 meters from tree cover.

## Methods

### Data Sources

The highest resolution tree-cover data currently available represents tree cover as a percentage at 30x30 meters resolution [@townshendjohn]. Values are the integers 0-100. Error for each cell is also provided, where the error is root mean squared error in units of percent cover [@sexton2016]. This data includes tree-cover images for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.

The US Forest Service provides a data set of all activities and their spatial extents for the southwest region, as well as data representing forest boundaries [@activiti]. The activity data used include the date completed, the project they were a part of, and the type of activity.

### Choosing a Thinning Project Area

USFS activities were selected that a) occurred in the Zuñi Mountains, b) were between the years 2000 and 2015, and c) not completed anytime within the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. This was to ensure that the treatment did not partially affect a subset of a polygon for a particular year. Activities that were labeled "Thinning for hazardous fuel reduction" were selected and grouped by completion date to create a set of candidate polygon-groups. All other activities deemed to potentially affect tree cover were subtracted away from the candidates. See the @sec-usfsAct for a detailed description. This ensures that the only activity occurring in the selected area was "Thinning for hazardous fuel reduction."

The above criteria resulted in three sets of polygons, grouped by completion date. The largest, which was completed in September of 2014, was part of the Bluewater Ecosystem Management Project and is referred to as "D-2 BW Thinning." The total extent of the thinning polygon is 3.24 km^2^. See @fig-context for an image which gives context for the location within the forest. This treatment was also found to have the most significant reduction in tree cover after thinning (see @fig-cover). This polygon is used for the remainder of the analysis.

Relative frequency histograms for each cover value, for the chosen polygon, are shown in @fig-hist. The dramatic shift in the peak from 2010 to 2015 indicates that overall the percent cover was reduced over that time period. Note that the maximum value for percent cover is 47% across all years. The average error for all cells with a particular cover value is by color in the plot. Error is RMSE in units of percent cover. The year 2015 has very low error, while the error is between 15% and 19% for previous years. Note that the unusually high occurrence of 0%, 39%, 45% cover cells in the year 2000, and 12% in 2010, do not show abnormally high average error. This indicates that, with respect to error values, there is no explanation for the abnormalities.

### Increasing Resolution via Stochastic Simulation

In order to assess if a cell is optimal or not it is necessary to A) categorize cells as either bare ground or tree-cover and B) use cells that are smaller than the threshold distance of 15m. To avoid using arbitrarily small cells, Google Earth Pro images of the Zuñi Mountains were used to characterize typical tree canopy diameters. Small tree were found to be approximately 3m in diameter (see @sec-3x3Reasoning). Therefore, it can be assumed that a 3mx3m cell is either bare ground, or completely covered by a tree (or part of a larger tree). Based on this assumption a stochastic simulation was used to generate a 3mx3m resolution image derived from the 30x30 meter percent-cover image.

The simulation works as follows: Each 30mx30m cell is subdivided into 100 3mx3m cells. Because there are 100 sub-cells per 30x30 meter cell, percent cover values translate directly to the number of covered sub-cells. This number of covered sub-cells is distributed randomly within the 30x30 cell. Therefore, the percent cover for the 30x30 cell is preserved. This operation is repeated for each 30x30 meter cell to convert the entire percent-tree-cover image into a simulated tree-cover distribution. This conversion is repeated 100 times for each year to create a spread of possible tree-cover distribution images. Note that clusters of 3x3m cells may be interpreted as multiple small trees or one large tree. See @fig-randExample for an example of one 30x30 meter cell being converted to 3x3 meter resolution via stochastic simulation. @fig-stochsim shows an entire stochastic simulation for the year 2000. @sec-compare compares Google Earth Pro imagery to stochastic simulations.

### Definition Of Optimal Condition for Snowpack Accumulation

Snowpack data is unavailable at high enough resolutions to be useful. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the potential for the forest to accumulate snow based on forest structure alone. A previous study in the Jemez Mountains found that the optimal condition for snowpack accumulation was, on average, clear ground within 15 meters of tree cover [@broxton2015]. This approximation does not take into consideration the observed pattern that snow accumulated less on south-facing sides of trees in the Jemez Mountains [@broxton2015], suggesting that in that region solar irradiation has relatively large impact on snow accumulation. Inspection of Google Earth Pro satellite imagery for the year 2021 reveals a pattern of snow accumulating to the north of tree cover (see @sec-visAsses). These observations are used to create criteria which classify bare ground as either optimal for snow accumulation or not. Because these criterion are simplified models of where snow will accumulate the best, we define multiple possible criterion and assess the impact of different criterion on the final result. Each criteria operates on the 3m x 3m simulated tree cover data, and asses whether a given bare-ground cell is optimal or not.

The chosen criteria are as follows:

#### Midday Shading Criterion: North Line {#sec-north-line}

A bare ground cell is optimal if there is a cluster of tree cover within 15 meters to the south (measured from the southern most edge of the cell, see @fig-focal B). This models snowpack as being primarily affected by midday sun exposure. The clusters of tree cover must be at or above a minimum threshold size. Thresholds considered here are 1 and 2 cells, which may be connected by an edge or by a corner. Setting the threshold to 2 cells effectively models small, isolated trees as ineffective for sheltering snow (see @fig-zoom, G). The visual effect of this is each cluster having a line of snow to the north, hence the name North Line.

#### General Shading and Wind Shelter Criterion: North Semicircle

A bare ground cell is optimal when a half-circle area to the south, centered on the cell in question, contains at least a threshold area of tree cover. The radius of the half-circle is roughly 15meters (pixelation prevents an exact circle, see @fig-focal, A). Threshold areas are set to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cells, respectively. This corresponds to 9, 18, 27, 36 and 45 m^2^ required covered area.

This criteria was developed based on the simple approximation from [@broxton2015a] which states that bare ground \<15m from canopy cover has more snow *and* more snow variability. The higher snow variability close to tree canopy is attributed to wind and sun effects, and an overall pattern of less snow on the southside of canopy cover was observed [@broxton2015a]. Therefore this criterion only considers areas in a semicircle to the north. As the threshold area increases this criterion approaches a model which combines both a) shading across a wider span of the day and b) protection from wind distribution. This is simply because as the threshold area increases it becomes more likely that cover exists to the south, east, and west, and anywhere in between. The visual effect of this is groups of trees having snow in a roughly half circle to the north, hence the name North Semicircle

All criteria were applied to each of the 100 simulated images and across all years. A zoomed in image of each criterion applied to one stochastic simulation for the year 2000 is shown in @fig-zoom. A comprehensive set of optimal images for each criteria is shown in @sec-optResults .

Finally, the total optimal area is calculated for each criterion applied to each simulation, across all years

## Results

The resulting optimal images are show in @sec-optResults. All total optimal areas for each criterion are shown in @fig-totOptArea. All criteria except North Semicircle with minimum threshold of 1 and 2 covered cells, respectively, result in a reduction of total optimal area after the 2014 thinning treatment. As the minimum number of covered cells increases for the North Semicircle criterion, the overall total optimal area decreases, across all years. For the North Line criteria the total optimal area across all years decreases as minimum cluster size goes from 1 to 2 cells. For both criteria the magnitude of the reduction in optimal area between 2010 and 2014 increases as the threshold increases. This can be visualized in @fig-totOptArea by the increasing slopes between 2010 and 2015.

The variation within each year, for all criterion, is small relative to the variation between years. This can be seen in @fig-totOptArea as the relatively small deviations from a straight line in each colored bar. Each simulation is plotted as a dot with slight transparency. All the dots for a given year-criterion pair are randomly distributed on a horizontal span. This visualizes the variation between simulations as deviations from a straight horizontal line. Variation between simulations, isolated by year, is visualized in @fig-totOptAreaSep. Note that this variation comes only from sub-optimal bare ground, because the number of covered cells is always the same between simulations.

## Discussion

The prediction was that the D-2 treatment within the Bluewater Ecosystem Management Project would create large clearings between trees, and therefore reduce the snow accumulation potential of the forest. The results confirm the prediction. All of the criterion that are reasonable models of snowpack accumulation result in a reduction of optimal area after thinning. The consistency of this result under different criterion adds support to the hypothesis.

Although two of the seven criterion result in an *increase* in optimal area after thinning, those criterion are not realistic models and should be discounted. The unrealistic criteria result from the North Semicircle criteria with minimum number of covered cells set to 1 (9m^2^) and 2 (18 m^2^) cells, respectively. These criteria effectively model snowpack as occurring in a semicircle around one or two small trees, even if they stand alone in a large clearing. No evidence of such a pattern is found in Google Earth Pro Pro imagery. Instead, snow appears on the north side of canopy cover, not in a semicircle ranging from east to west (see @sec-visAsses). The North Semicircle criteria with the threshold set to 4 or 5 cells is a better model of this pattern. At these threshold values it is more likely that an area designated as optimal will be to the north of tree cover, as well as protected by tree cover in other directions. These more realistic criteria result in a confirmation of the prediction (@fig-totOptArea, North Semicircle data, thresholds 4-5).

The simplest model based on visual evidence from Google Earth Pro represents snowpack as occurring on the north side of tree cover (North Line criteria) (see @sec-visAsses). Both the generous (minimum cluster size set to 1 cell) and more conservative (minimum cluster size set to 2 cells) versions of this criteria result in a reduction in optimal area after thinning.

There is relatively small variation in total optimal area between stochastic simulations for the same year and criteria (@fig-totOptArea). One possible explanation is as follows. For a particular criteria, specific spatial configurations will affect total optimal area. For example, the North Lines criteria with minimum cluster size set to 1 will have highest optimal area when tree cover is arranged in lines spaced at 15 meter intervals, running east to west. Similarly, lowest optimal area will occur when all the tree cover cells are bunched together in a north-south oriented oblong cluster. While there may be some relatively high probability of these extremes occurring for one 30mx30m cell, the probability that one of these extremes (high or low) occur for all 3,602 cells in the study area is low. In other words, extreme results cancel each other out at a sufficiently large spatial scale. A future study investigating the effect of spatial scale on these results would be required to prove this. This line of reasoning does not consider that the probabilities of extremes are bounded by, and depend on, percent cover values.

### Limitations

Observation of Google Earth Pro imagery suggests that two important missing factors for snow accumulation are aspect and elevation (see @sec-visAsses). Some clusters of tree cover did not have snow to the north, while some areas of bare ground greater than 15m from tree cover did have snow. This suggests that other factors impact snow accumulation in this area. A clear large scale pattern of more snow on the north faces, and closer to the major ridge of the Zuñi Mountains, suggests that the missing factors are aspect and elevation. A future study that incorporates these factors will likely create better approximations of snow accumulation potential.

Ultimately true snowpack spatial patterns are unknown. This study only investigates the *potential* of an area to accumulate snow.

This study simulates tree cover distribution at sub 30 meter spatial scales with randomness. In reality there are likely non-random spatial distributions at these scales. Including models of non-random or psuedo-random distributions in the simulations could increase the realism. Alternatively, applying the various optimality criterion to true tree cover distributions will greatly increase the certainty of the conclusion.

This study concludes that the optimal area decreased for the region of interest. However, the magnitudes of optimal area should only be used to interpret changes. The true magnitudes of optimal area are unknown. Note the drastic changes in magnitude due to choice of criteria in @fig-totOptArea.

## Conclusions

For the D-2 Bluewater thinning project the snowpack accumulation potential decreased after thinning. This suggests that the potential for that forest area to integrate water into the soil has decreased (see @sec-intro). While the present study focuses on an extreme change in tree cover, a similar method may be applied to other treatments that correspond to less drastic changes. Optimal area for snowpack accumulation results in a balance between tree cover and bare ground. Therefore it is possible that other treatments will be found to increase total optimal area. The methods presented here could be modified to find optimal canopy densities and spatial distributions for snowpack accumulation. This would be a step towards designing thinning patterns that are optimal with respect to snowpack. However, it would first be necessary to validate these methods against direct measurements of snowpack accumulation and canopy cover.

### Code Repository

The code developed to make this report is available at [github.com/UNM-Stakeholder-driven-Data-Analysis/ZuniMountainsSnow](https://github.com/UNM-Stakeholder-driven-Data-Analysis/ZuniMountainsSnow)

All analyses were performed using R Statistical Software (v4.2.1; R Core Team 2022). The R package called Terra was used for raster manipulations necessary in this analysis [@terra].

### Classification of USFS Activities {#sec-usfsAct}

Data was accessed though [@activitia]. The following activities are assumed to have no effect on tree cover:

```{r echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
print(NO_ALTER_TC, row.names=FALSE)
```

The following activities were assumed to effect tree cover. It was ensured that candidate polygons did not overlap these activities, for any date. Some of these activities, such as "Commercial Thin" and "Precommercial Thin" may actually have been performed to improve the resilience of forests to frequent-fire patterns and climate change. Future studies would benefit from expanding the scope to include more thinning projects that have different activity designations.

print(affectTC$x, row.names=F)
```

### Arriving at the 3-meter minimum cell size {#sec-3x3Reasoning}

The cell size for the stochastic simulation needed to be smaller than 15 meters, but not too small. Cells that were too small would result in isolated patches of tree cover smaller than those found in reality, and would result in unnecessarily slow computations. For this reason Google Earth Pro imagery from 2015 was used to find a representative lower limit for tree canopy diameter. The image from 2015 had lower tree density, making it easier to measure canopy diameter. Twenty points were randomly distributed within the D2-BW polygon. These were exported to Google Earth Pro (see @fig-randomPoints), where the nearest discernible tree shadow to each point was identified. Clusters of multiple trees who's shadows could not be distinguished were discounted (see @fig-shadowCluster for an example). If high tree density resulted in no discernible shadow in the neighborhood of the point, the canopy itself was measured. The shadow measurement was preferred because it provides a higher contrast image of the tree canopy against the ground. The sun's rays are assumed to be approximately parallel. Therefore the shadow's maximum width represents the tree's width from one particular vantage point. The distribution of resulting crown diameters are visualized in @fig-crownDiams.

@fig-crownDiams indicates that a reasonable lower limit for crown diameters is 3 meters. The box plot of the distributions shows that the lower quartile of the distribution is 2.64 meters, which is a good representative of a typical smallest tree canopy because it avoids including outliers. 2.64 meters was rounded up to 3 meters. Using a factor of 30 meters ensures that stochastic simulations will exactly preserve the percent cover values at the 30x30 meter scale.

### Visual Assessment of Snow Accumulation Patterns {#sec-visAsses}

A visual inspection of Google Earth Pro Pro imagery for the D2-W BW thinning polygon in the year 2021 reveals a pattern of snow accumulating on approximately the north side of clusters of trees (see @fig-snow2021 and @fig-snowZoom2021). It is notable that not all clusters of trees have snow to their immediate north. It is likely that the aspect of slope, or the lack of slope, results in this inconsistency. It is a recognized that ignoring aspect's impact on snowpack accumulation is a limitation of this study.

### Comparing to Real Imagery {#sec-compare}

The following figures depict Google Earth Pro imagery next to one stochastic simulation for the same year or nearby dates. Note that visual comparisons at this scale are biased by the presence of shadows in the real image. Shadows make canopy cover appear more dense than it really is. However, these comparisons can still be used to get a rough idea of how well the simulations approximate reality across different years. The nearest image available on Google Earth Pro to the year 2000 is 1997, so it is omitted. Google Earth Pro did not have an image for the year 2010, but did have images for 2009 and 2011. Both are shown below (@fig-2009-google and @fig-2011-google). The years 2005 and 2010 had higher average percent error than 2015 (see \@fig-hist), which may explain the presence of spurious low tree cover areas which appear in @fig-2009-google and @fig-2011-google. Overall the simulations do capture large scale (\>30m) patterns in tree cover density. This is highlighted in @fig-2015-google, where arrows indicate regions of high and low density that correspond in both images, respectively. It is notable that simulated images result in more small patches of tree cover distributed in low density areas, whereas real imagery indicates larger clearings between tree cover (see blue arrow in @fig-2015-google). This difference can be diminished by the choice of optimal ground criteria. For example, the North Line criteria (see @sec-north-line) with minimum cluster size of 2 effectively ignores single isolated cells in a clearing.

### Randomness Validation

In order to verify that the stochastic simulations are indeed random and are representative of the original percent tree-cover data, all the simulation layers were reclassified so that a covered cell had the value 1/100. Then all 100 layers were summed, giving a visual impression of the randomness and a way to compare all the simulations to the original data. If a particular cell was always covered by a tree, the resulting summed image would result in a pixel value of 1. Because percent-cover values never go above 50 a pixel value of 1 should never be observed in the summed simulation image, which is indeed the case. The results are below in @fig-alphasims. For convenience the original percent cover images are included below (@fig-again). Note that the summed image appears to well approximate the original cover image, as expected (year 2000).
